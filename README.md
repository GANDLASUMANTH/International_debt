# Analyze International Debt Statistics
In this project, we are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the answers to questions like:

What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset? Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like? What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

# RESULTS
Which country has the highest debt?
China seems to have the highest external debt i.e.$1430 Billion across 
all countries 

Which country has the least debt?
Tonga(a Polynesian island) seems to have the lowest external debt i.e.$159.855 Million across all countries 

What category of debt is highest across different countries?
On an average long-term external debt seems to be highest across 
all countries. Within long-term debt, private non-guaranteed category contributes majorly towards the international debt(49.4%). Official creditors(World Bank entities) contributing least (20%).


Does the income level has any effect on the debt level of the country?
The average debt of countries with Upper middle income level seems to be 
highest(64%) among all the countries and Low income level seems to be the least.

Does the income level has any effect on the debt level of the country?
The average debt of countries with Upper middle income level seems to be 
highest(64%) among all the countries and Low income level seems to be the least.

when the data is further analyzed in each bucket India seems to be having the best debt by topping the ‘official creditor’ category and Mexico topping the ‘Private creditors’ category. An interesting statistical conclusion we could make was that the total long-term debt for each country has a linear relationship to its overall GDP (R2 value of 0.86). We visually confirmed that countries with low income are in fact below the trend line of long term debt vs GDP and that upper middle-income class are above that trend line.
